## Description
Simple calculator following the Odin Project instructions but with a twist. I happened to have my calculator nearby and tried to replicate its functions. It has a buffer for the operations and evaluates them in one step. First it tokenizes the buffer and the validates the operations. After that it converts the operations to postfix so that it evaluates the operations in the correct order.

## To do list
* Add parentheses.
* Add more complex operations (exponentials?).
* Keyboard support.
* Look into problems with big numbers.

## Disclaimer
Do **not** use this calculator for actual calculations, it behaves weird with big numbers.
